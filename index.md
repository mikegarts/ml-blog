* Jeremy's fast.ai 2019 edition. Followed the video lectures and the textbook. 
  Binder doesn't work quite often but saw no reason to migrate the work to huggingface:
1. [Bear classifier example](https://github.com/mikegarts/bearsapp) 
2. [Multi category example](https://github.com/mikegarts/multicatapp)
3. [Pets example](https://github.com/mikegarts/petsapp)

* Mit deep learning course  http://introtodeeplearning.com/. A nice and quick course with colab notebooks as exercises. This one uses tensorflow.
* A little Sequential RNNs to generate music based on this course.
1. Transfer learning to the style of Joplin

* Coursera's Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization. It's a great step-by-step course

* Hugging face transformers
1. [Remarqify app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mikegarts/remarqify) on huggingface

* Kaggle courses:
1. [Intro](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
2. [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)
3. [Intermediate Ml](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
4. [Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization)
5. [sql](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql)
6. [Deep learning intro](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)
7. [Computer vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision)
8. [Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning)
9. [Geospatial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis)
10. [Explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability)

Probably the most interesting for me was the course about explainability since it gives you a basic toolkit to 
systematically improve upon the results. 
The data visualisation (and pandas) are also a great for pandas noobs (like me).  

* Kaggle challenges:
1. Titanic intro challenge
2. [Spaceship titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/code/michaelgartsbein/spaceship-titanic/notebook) challange. My best submission got me to top 10%: 

* fastai 2022 course
1. This blog :)
2. [fastai pets](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mikegarts/fastai_pets) on huggingface 2022 edition
