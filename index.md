* fastai 2022 course
  1. [lotr app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mikegarts/lotr) A cute app that combines language modeling, language summarization and image generation using the stable diffusion model.
     Here's a link to a [post](_posts/2020-06-11-image-generation-and-the-lotr-app.md) with more details
  2. [fastai pets](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mikegarts/fastai_pets) on huggingface 2022 edition
  3. This blog :)

* Kaggle challenges:
  1. [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/code/michaelgartsbein/auto-data-cleanup-huggingface-transformers). A top 17% result 
with a relatively small model (and a very quick training) but some interesting semi-automatic ML-driven data cleaning
  2. [Spaceship titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/code/michaelgartsbein/spaceship-titanic/notebook) challenge. My best submission got me to top 10%
  3. Titanic intro challenge

* [The huggingface course](https://huggingface.co/course)  
  1. [Remarqify app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mikegarts/remarqify) on huggingface. This app uses the distilgpt2 model retrained on books by Erich Maria Remarques

* Kaggle courses:
  1. [Intro](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
  2. [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)
  3. [Intermediate Ml](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
  4. [Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization)
  5. [sql](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql)
  6. [Deep learning intro](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)
  7. [Computer vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision)
  8. [Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning)
  9. [Geospatial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis)
  10. [Explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability)

Probably the most interesting for me was the course about explainability since it gives you a basic toolkit to 
systematically improve upon the results. 
The data visualisation (and pandas) are also a great for pandas noobs (like me).

* Coursera's Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization. 
It's a great step-by-step course with an emphasis on 'classical' regression in the beginning.

* [Mit deep learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) course. A free and quick course with colab notebooks as exercises.
One of the exercises included a sequential RNN to generate music based on this course. 
Here's what LSTM RNN can generate after a quick training on a few musical files and then fine tuning (transfer learning) to a genre:

  1. <audio controls> <source src="https://github.com/mikegarts/ml-blog/raw/main/resources/j_1_965.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>
     Transfer learning to the style of Joplin
  2. <audio controls> <source src="https://github.com/mikegarts/ml-blog/raw/main/resources/chopinpreludes_0_5550.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>
     Transfer learning to the style of Chopin 

Approaching this using transformers would probably yield much better result.

* Jeremy's fast.ai 2019 edition. Followed the video lectures and the textbook. 
  Binder doesn't work too well but I saw no reason to migrate the work to huggingface:
  1. [Bear classifier example](https://github.com/mikegarts/bearsapp) 
  2. [Multi category example](https://github.com/mikegarts/multicatapp)
  3. [Pets example](https://github.com/mikegarts/petsapp)
